<h1>Hi {{currentUser.firstName}}!</h1>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<div>
    <span>Current Devices</span>
    <!-- tried to give this a go
    My thinking on this, is to add the devices into a table or list below is the documentation i was following
    https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat -->
    <div ng-repeat="item in userDevices.name">
        {{item}}
    </div>
</div>
